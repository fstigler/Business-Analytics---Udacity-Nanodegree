## Overview
This program is an excellent program for non-technical people who want to make more data driven decisions. You’ll learn data analysis skills and tools that will help you throughout your career, whether
you’re in engineering, sales, marketing, operations, etc. You’ll learn to use Excel, SQL, and Tableau to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data with the end goal of making better, data-informed decisions. This
program is also great preparation for more advanced programs, such as the Data Analyst or Business Analyst Nanodegree programs. Depending on how quickly you work through the material, the amount of time required is variable. We have included an hourly estimation for each section of the program. The program is three months long. If
you spend about 10 hours per week working through the program, you should finish the program in three months.

## Course 1: Welcome to the Program
In the lessons leading to your first project, you will get to know your instructors and learn how data is being applied in many industries. You’ll also learn about course structure, navigation, learning resources,
deadlines, projects, and everything that will help you succeed in this course. You will then get to work on your first project, where you will draw insights from interactive dashboards.
A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. This project will build your intuition on working with data dashboards, while also showing you the
types of beautiful visualizations you will be able to produce by the end of this program!

## Course 2: Introduction to Data
Learn how to use statistics and visuals to find and communicate insights. Develop Excel skills to manipulate,analyze, and visualize data in a spreadsheet. Build Excel models to analyze possible business outcomes.

## Course 3: SQL for Data Analysis
In this project, you will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. You’ll use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and recommendations in a report.

## Course 4: Data Visualization with Tableau
Sharing insights is an integral part of working with data. In this project, you’ll build interactive dashboards with Tableau to tell stories from data. You’ll use a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more. These types of visualizations help guide decision making to reach the best outcomes.
